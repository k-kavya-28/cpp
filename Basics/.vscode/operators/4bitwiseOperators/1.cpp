// 0 and 1 are two bits
// bitwise operators operates on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation
//XOR operator returns 0 if both the operands are same and 1 if different
// same 0 // diff 1
// ~ one's complement
// left shit operator - shifts the bits of a number to the left side and the no of places is mentioned
//a<<n is a*2^n
//a>>n is a/2^n
